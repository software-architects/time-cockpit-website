<p>Some time cockpit beta users reported problems when viewing projects or timesheets in the administration module. The following exception occured when they tried to open a list of projects or timesheets:</p><p class="Code">Object reference not set to an instance of an object.</p>{% highlight text %}at System.Windows.Automation.Peers.AutomationPeer.EnsureChildren()
at System.Windows.Automation.Peers.AutomationPeer.UpdateChildrenInternal(Int32 invalidateLimit)
at System.Windows.Automation.Peers.AutomationPeer.UpdateChildren()
...{% endhighlight %}<p>Finally we found out that this exception was caused by a windows service named "Tablet PC Input Service" and it is unique to entities that contain date and time fields. Stopping this service solves the problem.</p><p>Find more information under <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/316681/nullreferenceexception-in-system-windows-automation-peers-groupitemautomationpeer-getchildrencore" target="_blank">http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/316681/nullreferenceexception-in-system-windows-automation-peers-groupitemautomationpeer-getchildrencore</a>.</p><h2>Workaround</h2><p>To resolve this problem stop the "Tablet PC Input Service".Â </p>
