<p>Until now overlapping time sheet entries were not displayed too smart. We ordered all items by begin time and displayed them next to each other as long as the new item overlaps any of the previously displayed items.</p><p>

</p><p>In the new version for Winter 2012/2013 we will fix this behavior. We still order all items by begin time but then we check, if there is a place for each new item in any of the previously displayed columns.</p><p>
