<p>Last month we have first released the new <a href="http://www.timecockpit.com/blog/2013/10/29/Reporting-Preview" title="Reporting in time cockpit">reporting feature in time cockpit</a>. In the December version of time cockpit we have added lots of new functions to make reporting more useful for you.</p><h2>Functionality of the Current Preview Release</h2><h3>Customization</h3><p>Left to the report preview you can now see the configuration pane for the report. It allows you to change the layout and page setup for the report.</p><p>

</p><h3>Groups and Sums</h3><p>When generating a report, time cockpit now respects customizations you have made to the list like grouping, sorting and the order of the columns.</p><p>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/content/images/blog/2013/11/Reporting/GroupedReport.png" alt="Groups in Reporting" title="Groups in Reporting" />
</p><p>By default, all groups are expanded. In Microsoft Excel you can expand and collapse groups.</p><p>

</p><h3>Filter Conditions</h3><p>In the header of a report, all filter conditions are displayed. Filters displayed in gray are not set, filters displayed in white have a value set.</p><p>

</p><h3>Further Improvements</h3><ul>
  <li>The default value for generated files now contains the name of the list combined with the current date and time.</li>
  <li>Page number and generation date of the report are displayed in the footer.</li>
</ul><h2>Plans for Upcoming Releases</h2><p>The new reporting feature is still in preview mode. We would love to <a href="mailto:support@timecockpit.com" title="Send us your feedback">hear your feedback</a> on the existing functions and about your wishes for the future. Our plans for the next versions of time cockpit include the following features:</p><h3>Customizing</h3><ul>
  <li>We want to allow you to add a logo to the report's header.</li>
  <li>It should be possible to enter a custom page size.</li>
  <li>All customization values should be useable as default values for new reports. You should not need to change the color or font family for every report. If a default value is set, is should be used for all reports and users.</li>
</ul><h3>Advanced Reports</h3><p>At the moment you can only convert lists to reports. In the future we want to allow you to build your own custom reports with tables, cross tables and charts. <a href="http://www.timecockpit.com/blog/2013/10/29/Reporting-Preview#advanced" title="Advanced Reporting Functions">Read more about the advanced reporting functions ...</a></p>
