<p>In this release of time cockpit we have mainly improved the new reporting feature.</p><p>
  <strong>The new version December 2013 (1.19) is downwards compatible to version March 2013 (1.10) and later. You can use all of these versions in a single account simultaneously.</strong>
</p><h2>Reporting</h2><p>We have added several new functions to the reporting feature this month:</p><ul>
  <li>Title, font, color, page setup, etc. can be customized.</li>
  <li>Groups, sums, sort order and order of columns are taken over from the list.</li>
  <li>Filter conditions are displayed in the report.</li>
  <li>The default value for generated files now contains the name of the list combined with the current date and time.</li>
  <li>Page number and generation date of the report are displayed in the footer.</li>
</ul><p>
