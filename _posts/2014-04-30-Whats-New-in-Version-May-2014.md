<p>The new version May 2014 (1.24) is downwards compatible to version March 2013 (1.10) and later. You can use all of these versions in a single account simultaneously.<br /></p><h2>Time Cockpit OData API</h2><p>Years ago when we defined the cornerstones of time cockpit, we decided that extensibility should be a major unique selling proposition of our time tracking software. This month, we are very proud that we can publish the first public preview of a major keystone of our technological strategy: Say hello to time cockpit's new <em>OData Web API</em>.</p><p>OData is a standard that can connect application like time cockpit or Excel with SaaS services like time cockpit running in the cloud. It is available on many different platforms and it works perfectly for smart clients like time cockpit's offline-enabled full client as well as for thin clients running in the browser. Find more information on how to use the brand new OData API at the following sources:</p><ul>

</p><h3>Full Client</h3><p>This month we focused on the OData Web API mentioned above. Therefore we did not change very much in the full client. The new version contains some minor bug fixes. Additionally, the OData Web API documentation has been added to the offline help.</p>
