title: What's New in Version November 2015
excerpt: This month we focused on bringing time cockpit's Excel importer to the HTML 5 web client. It is true, there are other ways to load data into time cockpit which are fancier (see OData Web API). But if you need a pragmatic but powerful way that most users can relate to, you might consider the time cockpit Excel importer for import tasks.

<p>The new version November 2015 (1.42) is downwards compatible to version March 2013 (1.10) and later. You can use all of these versions in a single account simultaneously. </p><p>This month we focused on bringing time cockpit's Excel importer to the HTML 5 web client. Users are now able to import data using existing time cockpit import definitions. The next step will be to bring the elaborate import definition designer to the web.</p><p>It is true, there are other ways to load data into time cockpit which are fancier (see <a href="~/blog/2014/09/26/Accessing-Time-Cockpits-OData-Web-API-With-Visual-Studio" target="_blank">OData Web API</a>). But if you need a pragmatic but powerful way that most users can relate to, you might consider the time cockpit Excel importer for import tasks. Here are the advantages of the built-in importer at a glance:</p><ul>
  <li>Excel is a quite common data exchange format. Excel files and the corresponding import definitions are self-describing and thus easy to understand.</li>
  <li>The importer requires no programming/scripting skills. Users can perform import tasks themselves.</li>
  <li>The importer is a standard interface that lets you import any data you like to manage in time cockpit. No dedicated import jobs interfaces to be developed.
<br /></li>
  <li>Result logs of past imports are stored historically.</li>
