<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Today we will release SP1 for time cockpit 2010. In this blog we would like to summarize the changes in this program version. Note that the setup for time cockpit 2010 SP1 can be used to install a new, fresh copy of time cockpit and to update an existing installation of time cockpit 2010.</p><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Corrected Bugs</h2><ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <li>In the previous version of time cockpit 2010 it could happen that the sync process does not sync data items if the blob store of the Windows Azure platform is not available. This issue has been fixed in SP1.</li>
  <li>Better error messages in data export to Microsoft Office Excel.</li>
  <li>Because of a bug in the system with which we generate the time cockpit help files (Sandcastle) the SDK documentation of the previous version of time cockpit 2010 did not contain all available members. The SP1 build has been created with a corrected version of Sandcastle. Therefore the member lists are now complete.</li>
</ul><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">New Functionalities</h2><ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <li>Software and time cockpit website are fully translated in English. Note that parts of the help system are still German-only.</li>
