title: What's New in Version April 2013
teaser: In version April 2013 we have focused on the formatting profiles in the time sheet calendar. Until now we only showed a color legend in the navigation bar on the left side, but there is much more information we can display so we decided to change the color legend to a bar chart.

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In version April 2013 we have focused on improving the formatting profiles in the time sheet calendar. Until now we only showed a color legend in the navigation bar on the left side, but there is much more information we can display so we decided to change the color legend to a bar chart.</p><f:function name="Composite.Media.ImageGallery.Slimbox2" xmlns:f="http://www.composite.net/ns/function/1.0">

</f:function><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the new version you are able to define a key figure for each formatting profile. In the screenshot above you see a formatting profile for billable and non-billable hours. The length of the bars represents the number of hours. You can use any numeric field in time sheet entries for the key figure (e.g. <span class="inlineCode">DurationInHours</span>, <span class="inlineCode">Revenue</span>).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">You can now display multiple formatting profiles in the navigation menu, but only one of them can be active. Click anywhere in the bar chart to select the formatting profile.Â The active profile defines the conditional formatting in your time sheet calendar. Its bar chart is displayed in color. All other formatting profiles are inactive and displayed in gray.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

From version autumn 2012 to version March 2013 we have updated SQL CE from version 4.0.8482.1 to version 4.0.8876.1. Unfortunately we experienced some problems with the new version that could even cause data loss in rare cases. In version April 2013 we stepped back to the previous version of SQL CE, with which we have never seen this problem.</p><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">New Version of ClosedXML for Excel Export</h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For exporting data to Microsoft Excel we use <a href="http://closedxml.codeplex.com/" title="ClosedXML on CodePlex" target="_blank">ClosedXML</a>.
