  <li>Page number and generation date of the report are displayed in the footer.</li>
</ul><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plans for Upcoming Releases</h2><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The new reporting feature is still in preview mode. We would love to <a href="mailto:support@timecockpit.com" title="Send us your feedback">hear your feedback</a> on the existing functions and about your wishes for the future. Our plans for the next versions of time cockpit include the following features:</p><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Customizing</h3><ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <li>We want to allow you to add a logo to the report's header.</li>
  <li>It should be possible to enter a custom page size.</li>
  <li>All customization values should be useable as default values for new reports. You should not need to change the color or font family for every report. If a default value is set, is should be used for all reports and users.</li>
</ul><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Advanced Reports</h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the moment you can only convert lists to reports. In the future we want to allow you to build your own custom reports with tables, cross tables and charts. <a href="http://www.timecockpit.com/blog/2013/10/29/Reporting-Preview#advanced" title="Advanced Reporting Functions">Read more about the advanced reporting functions ...</a></p>
