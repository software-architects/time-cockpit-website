title: PS, ALM Days Talk Bugfix
teaser: My ALM Days talk about building in the cloud went fine. However, the last demo didn't fully work and I finally ran out of time. That's the risk of a 100% live coding session. The reason was a small mistake that I made while standing on stage. Here is the description of the mistake. Hope it helps you to avoid doing the same.
