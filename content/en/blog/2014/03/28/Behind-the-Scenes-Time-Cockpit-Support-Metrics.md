<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Support is an important aspect when offering software as a service. After all, SaaS is not only about selling a piece of software but also providing a great overall usage experience. We use <a href="http://www.zendesk.com" target="_blank">Zendesk</a> for managing our support work. Want to know how we are doing? Here are some facts from Q1/2014.</p><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Channels</h2><ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <li>68% of all support tickets are created via email to <a href="mailto:support@timecockpit.com">support@timecockpit.com</a>.</li>
  <li>In 28% of all cases, customers used the contact form on our website.</li>
  <li>The rest of the tickets was initiated via a support chat on our website.</li>
</ul><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reply Time
<br /></h2><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We do not use auto-reply emails. Therefore, the average reply time is the time until an engineer has really looked at the support incident personally and has provided substantial feedback to the customer. In Q1 we managed to reply to 52% of all support cases within 0-1 hours. This includes tickets that arrived outside of our business hours (e.g. during Austria's night, weekends, etc.).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We are constantly working on that metric. In March 2014 for instance we managed to raise it to 54%. We managed to answer within 8 wall clock hours in 75% of all cases.</p><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Feedback?</h2><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What is your impression of our support quality? Are we doing well or do we have to improve? We love to hear your feedback at <a href="mailto:support@timecockpit.com">support@timecockpit.com</a>.</p>
