     No Time Tracking At All, Seriously?    
    </h2>
      <p>    
     You do not need to track your time at all, really? You are lucky ;-)    
    </p>
      <p>    
     We sometimes see this in startups, non-commercial teams (e.g. developers    
     of open source software), and hobby projects. This approach is fine for such teams. However, if your    
     team grows, if you need to earn money with your work, or as soon as you get employees, things change. In many countries, the    
     law forces you to have at least a basic attendance tracking to be able to monitor compliance to working time regulations.    
    </p>
      <p>    
     As your team gets bigger, you should also consider project time tracking to enable efficient time and resource management    
     and streamline backoffice processes (e.g. billing).    
    </p>
      <p>

     Basic Time Tracking With Lots of Possible Improvements    
    </h2>
      <p>    
     You have some basic time tracking in place but there is still a lot of room for improvements.    
    </p>
      <p>    
     Your current solution might be sufficient for you if your revenue and costs are not driven by your team members' working time (e.g. production company).    
     If you work in a services company, you should consider a more elaborate solution for time tracking. There is a certain    
     risk that you lose money (e.g. billable hours) because of untracked or wrongly entered time sheet records.    
    </p>
      <p>    
     Even if you only    
     do projects with fixed prices, a time tracking database is important on the long run. You can e.g. use it to calculate your effective    
     margins of certain projects. Additionally it might be a useful data source when estimating new projects: you can learn from    
     the past.

      <p>    
     It is obvious that you have spent some time thinking about time tracking in your team. You have done the    
     first important steps. Now it is time to take the next steps. Here are some examples:    
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>    
      Did you already implement standard reporting or dashboards based on your time tracking data? Making the right KPIs    
      easily available helps the team staying on track. Otherwise different people will do the same analysis e.g. in Excel    
      over and over again - unnecessary waste of time.    
     </li>
        <li>    
      An alerting system that notifies your e.g. project managers if a project runs out of budget might help to prevent    
      unpleasant surprises.    
     </li>
        <li>    
      There might be cost saving potential by streamlining your business processes around time tracking. Avoid unnecessary,    
      manual work by automating interfaces, providing specific reports, etc.    
     </li>
      </ul>
