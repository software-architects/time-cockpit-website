<p>It feels like yesterday when we moved into our first single-room office in the Techcenter Linz a few years ago. That was the time when we had written the business plan for time cockpit and started to write the first few lines of code for our new product. Within two years our team grew from two persons, Karin and I, to five. We had to find a different solution.</p><p>Our second location was an apartment building in Leonding where we rented the ground floor. It had been a great place to work for the last few years. However, meanwhile we are six people and still growing. Therefore, some month ago we decided it was time to change again. Luckily we found a great office building close by with available space. No sooner said than done: We decided to rebuild the office a bit and make it the new home of the time cockpit team.</p><p>

</p><h2>Rebuilding Chaos</h2><p>Granted, refactoring in real world is different than refactoring code. This is what our new office looked like just a few days ago. At that point we never thought that we could move in at the end of July. But today I am writing this article already sitting in my new office and everything works. Ok, not everything is perfect yet but we are on track.</p><p>

</p><p>By the way, don't worry about your time cockpit data. Of course it is not affected by our moving or the chaos you see above. Our entire server infrastructure is in the cloud what made moving a way lot easier.</p><h2>The Move</h2><p>To be honest, our bones hurted when we got up this morning. Yesterday was moving day. We carried a lot of furniture around, brought the network to life, connected everything to the internet, ... Yesterday's morning still was a bit chaotic:</p><p>

</p><p>But in the late afternoon everything was up and running and we could start to work again.</p><p>

</p><h3>What's Next?</h3><p>Our meeting room is still empty, some minor renovation work has still to be done, and - most important - we have to plan the big house warming party. So we will not get bored in the next weeks.</p><p>We love our new office already and hope that many time cockpit customers will come to visit us in the near future.</p><h3>Our New Address</h3><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d2655.6622155619393!2d14.2685138!3d48.270874600000006!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x477396549be9de91%3A0xc6cf9a4b5fa51f37!2sWelser+Stra%C3%9Fe+26%2C+4060+Leonding!5e0!3m2!1sde!2sat!4v1406874724324" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" style="border:0"></iframe><p>software architects gmbh<br />Welser Stra√üe 26<br />4060 Leonding<br />Austria</p><p>Phone: +43 732 673575</p>
