It now supports <em>compound keys</em>.Â Compound keys are keys that consist of more than one column. This new feature is especially relevant if you want to import transactional data like time sheet records. In contrast to base data (e.g. customer, projects, etc.), transactional data typically does not have a primary key like a code or an ID. Therefore it is important to be able to mark multiple columns that form the primary key together.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following screenshot shows how to set a compound key in time cockpit's importer:</p><f:function name="Composite.Media.ImageGallery.Slimbox2" xmlns:f="http://www.composite.net/ns/function/1.0">
