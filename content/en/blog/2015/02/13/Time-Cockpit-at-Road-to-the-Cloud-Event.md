Here is my slide deck:</p><script async="async" class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="1a0a032ba298492a857716f98b63d183" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script><h2>Cloud Business and Cost Models</h2><p>It was originally planned that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerdsaurer" target="_blank">Gerd Saurer</a> from Microsoft Austria should do this session. However, Gerd could not participate because of private reasons. As this topic is important for me, I jumped in and did the talk. I hope that people liked my content although I did not have much time to prepare. Here is my slide deck:</p><script async="async" class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="0d7926345e8e40ec97f876c654ddb964" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script><h2>Case Study</h2><p>In the closing session, Christian and I talked a little bit about how we use the Azure cloud for our own products. I used some of the content I preprepared for my recent talk at the German OOP conference.</p><p class="showcase">If you are interested in learning about how we use the cloud for Application Lifecycle Management, you can find the related content <a href="http://www.software-architects.com/devblog/2015/01/27/OOP-2015-ALM-in-the-Cloud-with-Visual-Studio-Online-and-Azure" target="_blank">in this blog post</a> (including sample video).</p><h2>Photos</h2><p>Before the event I took some photos.
