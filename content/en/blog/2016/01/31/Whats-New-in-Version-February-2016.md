<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The new version February 2016 (1.45) is downwards compatible to version March 2013 (1.10) and later. You can use all of these versions in a single account simultaneously.</p><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Summary</h2><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Database Migration</h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In January, we finally migrated all our production databases in Microsoft Azure from the old web/business-edition-model to new v12 database servers.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Time cockpit's version February 2016 has been optimized for the new database servers. We made enhancements to time cockpit's internal synchronization algorithm. This change significantly reduces the necessary server resources during synchronization and therefore speeds up the process.</p><p class="showcase" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of this change, we really ask you to upgrade your full client to the latest version. This helps us keeping operational costs and therefore time cockpit's monthly fee as low as it currently is.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The new version February 2016 (1.45) is downwards compatible to version March 2013 (1.10) and later.

  <a href="https://products.office.com/" target="_blank">Office 365</a> is a very successful cloud service from Microsoft. Millions of people all over the globe use it for emails, document management, communication, etc. This month, we added an out-of-the-box integration with Office 365 to <a href="http://web.timecockpit.com" target="_blank">time cockpit's HTML5 timesheet calendar</a>. See all your Outlook appointments in time cockpit and turn them into timesheet records with a simple double-click.</p><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Full Client and Self-Service Portal Enhancements</h3><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to extending the HTML5 client, we also enhanced the full-client and time cockpit's administration website:</p><ol xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <li>In the past, you could work with time cockpit offline without synchronization for up to 30 days. After that period, time cockpit assumed that the computer is not used anymore and prevented further synchronizations. To reactivate, you have to reset time cockpit and do a full sync. In response to concrete customer demand, we extended the period without sync to 60 days. However, a regular warning message appears after 30 days without synchronization.</li>
  <li>Since time cockpit was first released years ago, we published quite a large number of software versions. This led to inconveniently long wait times whenever you want to get a download link for the latest time cockpit full client on <a href="~/sign-in" target="_blank">time cockpit's self-service portal</a>. This month, we significantly enhanced this feature. Now it takes you a much shorter time to get the latest and greatest time cockpit full client download link.</li>
