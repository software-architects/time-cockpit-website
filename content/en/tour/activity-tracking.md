      <h2>Reconstruct Your Day
				</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Reconstruct the time you spend working on your PC with time cockpit’s signal trackers.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Turn on time cockpit’s signal tracker to automatically get a log of your work done on your PC. Import the call history from your phone if phone calls are relevant for your time sheet. As a developer connect time cockpit to your Microsoft Team Foundation Server to see when you checked in files and when changes happened to your work items.

      <h2>Privacy
				</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>You are in control over your Signal Trackers and time cockpit keeps activity logs 100% private.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Time cockpit is not a spyware tool! Your privacy is crucial to us. Every user can temporarily or permanently disable activity tracking. Time cockpit offers no functions to centrally control activity tracking for the entire team. You can delete your old activity logs permanently with just a few mouse clicks.
				</p>
      <p>Time cockpit encrypts your activity log with a password that you personally choose. Time cockpit uses it only on your PC and does not store it centrally.

      <h2>Signal Trackers
				</h2>
      <p>Time cockpit comes with a variety of Signal Trackers that build your activity log.
				</p>
      <ul class="checkList">
        <li>Com<span data-mce-type="bookmark" id="mce_1_start" data-mce-style="overflow:hidden;line-height:0px" style="overflow:hidden;line-height:0px"></span>puter and User Activity <br /> Records when you have been actively working on your PC. For knowledge workers periods of inactivity often indicate e. g. meetings or breaks.
					</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Active Application</strong>
          <br /> Logs the applications that you have been actively working with. You might recall that you have worked on a specific customer presentation when you see a longer block of time for Microsoft Office PowerPoint.
					</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Windows Titles</strong>
          <br /> Your activity log shows you the title of the windows you have been actively working in. For Microsoft Office you will instantly see e. g. which document or email you worked on. Developers will see the project name of Microsoft Visual Studio.
					</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sent Emails</strong>
          <br /> As a knowledge worker you might spend a significant amount of time writing emails. With time cockpit you can easily identify the times when you were busy answering emails. Additionally you will identify specific mails that you worked on for a longer time and that might result in billable hours.
					</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Written Files</strong>
          <br /> Directory and file names often give you an indication about the customer or the project you worked on. time cockpit can monitor directories on local drives and show you how long you worked on the corresponding files before saving them.
					</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Notes</strong>
          <br /> Leave yourself a note about what you just did while not working on your PC (e.g. unplanned meeting with a colleague). If you have been away from your computer for a couple of minutes, the notes tracker pops up automatically and asks you if you want to leave a note. The notes appear in the time sheet calendar when you will need them to fill your time sheet.
					</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Call History</strong>
          <br /> Import your call history if you have a mobile phone or phone system that can export your calls. time cockpit lets you easily convert phone calls to time sheet entries.
					</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Microsoft Team Foundation Server</strong>
          <br /> As a developer you might begin a certain task by setting the corresponding work item’s status to “in progress” and complete it by checking in your files. Time cockpit shows you such activities in your time sheet calendar’s activity log.<span data-mce-type="bookmark" id="mce_1_end" data-mce-style="overflow:hidden;line-height:0px" style="overflow:hidden;line-height:0px"></span></li>
