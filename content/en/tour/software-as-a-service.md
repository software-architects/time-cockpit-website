        <strong>With time cockpit you only pay what you really use.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Time cockpit is like a natural skin, it grows with you. You add, remove or even temporarily suspend users as needed. We calculate your monthly fee based on the number of active users per day. There is no minimum amount of users and no commitment period. If you do not need time cockpit anymore you can cancel your subscription on any day without any period of notice.

      <h2>Powerful and Reliable Cloud Infrastructure
				</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Time cockpit runs on the Microsoft Azure Platform.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Your time cockpit environment in the cloud will run on the <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure Platform</a>. We deploy all components of time cockpit in the European data centers of Microsoft Azure. All our production databases are three-node database clusters. Backups for disaster recovery are managed by Microsoft; they are stored redundantly in both European data centers. All our webservers are clusters each with at least two servers for load balancing and fault tolerance.
